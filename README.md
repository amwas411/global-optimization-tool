# Global optimization tool
  This is a tool that enables you to take the global minimum of the given function. 
  A function should be of no more than 9 different variables. 
  To name a variable you need to call it like 'x<number from 1 to 9>'. For example, correct function input would be 'x1^2+2*x1*x2+x2^2'.
  Some of the textboxes of the tool take input in vector form. For example if the given function is of 2 variables then the upper boundary parameter may be '10 10' and lower boundary '-10 -10'. Variables in the lower boundary should be less than variables in the upper boundary.
